c++ compiler does operations involving different data types by converting all involved variables to the same data type, usually the data type
capable of expressing the largest range of positive values
Fun Tip: to find the data type of a variable you do not know, add it by a completely unrelated data type ie (t.size() + vector <int> {}) and look
at the compiler error for the data types involved, i.e. "mismatched types: long long unsigned int and std::vector..."
If you add u to the suffix of a number, it becomes unsigned, i.e. 10u is an unsigned 10.

Compilation flag -Werror prevents signed/unsigned comparisons from happening and allowing for safer code.
Be careful when using signed and unsigned types. When using both types in expressions, stactic cast one type for the other
